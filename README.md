# Urban-Traffic-Data-Hack

Integrated environment for parking management and traffic volume visualization and forecast.

We propose an innovative solution for integrating the data available from different sources. 
The municipality of Zwolle already has data about population demographics, traffic in the city centre and its surroundings, bicycle transits at traffic lights, traveling time measurements, waiting times at the traffic lights, traffic accidents, maps of the road works, GPS and WiFi traffic data, information about big events (such as King's Day)  among the others.

Much information about the mobility can be obtained combining data from different sources and can be a valuable instrument to enhance smart mobility in the city.
